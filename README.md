# Change-Dispensing-Machine
This repository contains the course project for the course CS216 Digital Logic Design. 
Instructor: Dr. Nandakumar Nambath

The system dispenses change for an inserted bill in any combination of smaller denomination bills the user asks for.
We have designed a finite state machine (FSM) for modeling the money dispensing machine.
The code of the FSM is in VHDL and we used Arduino Mega and FPGA as hardware components.
